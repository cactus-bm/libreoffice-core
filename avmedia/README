Audio/Video media implementation.

Provides per-platform implementations of multimedia functionality.
Currently no stream API is provided, only a URI based one, so
streaming has to be wrapped around it via temp files.

Also provides (in source/framework/mediacontrol.cxx) an implementation
of the graphical media playback control that appears in the toolbar /
mediaobject bar when media is selected under the .uno:AVMediaToolBox
item.
