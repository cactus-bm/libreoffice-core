Layout engine for OpenOffice.org  -  Work in Progress

Simple dialogs have been ported now: zoom and wordcount.

Code lives in "layout" CWS.

* Ceckout layout cws.

* Configure using --enable-layout.

* dmake all

* dmake install DESTDIR=$(pwd)/ooo-layout/

* Source refresh in workben/layout, do something like

    cd toolkit/workben/layout && . ./refresh --inst .../ooo-layout/

Integration into OOo:

* After instaling, run

  cd ooo-cvs/program
  ./soffice.bin

  Start a [Writer] document and choose View/Zoom or Extra/Word count.
