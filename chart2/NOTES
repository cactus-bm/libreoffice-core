NOTES
=====

Installation
------------

in workbench/officeintegration you find a perl script 'install.pl' for doing all
necessary changes to enable the chart in an office.

Note:
* Start a freshly installed Office at least once before you call this script.
* the TypeDetection.xcu of your user-registry is simply overwritten.
* the libraries are linked on Unix machines, on Windows they are just copied, so
  keep them updated.
* Start the new chart with 'soffice private:factory/chart' or by entering
  'private:factory/chart' in the URL field of an application.


FileDataSource
--------------

For testing the FileDataSource:  Currently the following files are read (hard-coded)
* Win:  D:\files\data.chd
* Unix: /work/data/data.chd

You can find sample data in workbench/sampledata

Testing
-------

To create a chart using the abovementioned file for data, Call the menu item
'File/Save all'.  To rebuild the chart call 'File/Save'.

You can also create a chart from spreadsheet data.

ToDo
----

The following things should be done before going "online" at
OpenOffice.org.

* the drafts namespace should vanish from the UNO types when they are finalized
