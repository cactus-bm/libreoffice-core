Activate the New Chart
----------------------

After installation of an Office, you will still get the old chart
implementation.  In order to get the new implementation you have to activate it
via the configuration.

Set the boolean Config-Item Office.Common/Internal:DevelopmentChart to true.

HOW-TO:

* Open the file Common.xcu of the Registry.

Location on Unix:
$HOME/StarOffice7/user/registry/data/org/openoffice/Office/Common.xcu 

Location on Windows:
"%UserProfile%\Application Data\StarOffice7\user\registry\data\org\openoffice\Office\Common.xcu"

* Under the configuration-node "Internal" (see <node oor:name="Internal"> tag)
  you have to add the property "DevelopmentChart" and set this to "true":

* Add the following after the "Internal"-node:

  <prop oor:name="DevelopmentChart" oor:type="xs:boolean">
   <value>true</value>
  </prop>

After that, your Common.xcu may look like this:

,----[ Common.xcu example ]
| <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
| <oor:component-data xmlns:oor="http://openoffice.org/2001/registry" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" oor:name="Common" oor:package="org.openoffice.Office">
|  <node oor:name="Internal">
|   <prop oor:name="DevelopmentChart" oor:type="xs:boolean">
|    <value>true</value>
|   </prop>
|   <prop oor:name="CurrentTempURL" oor:type="xs:string">
|    <value/>
|   </prop>
|  </node>
|  <node oor:name="Help">
|   <node oor:name="Registration">
|    <prop oor:name="ReminderDate" oor:type="xs:string">
|     <value xsi:nil="true"/>
|    </prop>
|    <prop oor:name="RequestDialog" oor:type="xs:int">
|     <value>0</value>
|    </prop>
|   </node>
|  </node>
|  <node oor:name="Misc">
|   <prop oor:name="FirstRun" oor:type="xs:boolean">
|    <value>false</value>
|   </prop>
|  </node>
| </oor:component-data>
`----

* To switch back, you can either replace the "true" by a "false", or you can
  delete the complete "DevelopmentChart" property (the three lines) you
  inserted.

FileDataSource
--------------

For testing the FileDataSource:  Currently the following files are read (hard-coded)
* Win:  D:\files\data.chd
* Unix: /work/data/data.chd

You can find sample data in workbench/sampledata

Testing
-------

* To create a chart using the abovementioned file for data, Call the menu item
  'File/Save all'.  To rebuild the chart call 'File/Save'.

* You can also create a chart from spreadsheet data.

* To run a test for the old API run "dmake" in the qa subdirectory.

ToDo
----

* Remove "drafts" from *every* UNO-IDL object.

* Split API into public part (used by other applications) and a private part
  that remains in the chart2 project.  The public part has to go to the offapi
  project.
