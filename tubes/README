Interface to Telepathy Tubes.

To enable configure LibO with --enable-telepathy

Status 2012-03-16:

* no LibO code depends on this module yet, so it is not built in a regular
  build, even if configured with --enable-telepathy, so cd tubes and make here
  * to enable the various SAL_INFO and SAL_WARN messages emitted during
    cppunittest pass SAL_LOG=... and do a debug build
  * SAL_LOG="+WARN+INFO.tubes" make -rs debug=true
  * the cppunittest will currently fail anyway (even if it wouldn't for other
    reasons), this is on purpose to be able to see the output as otherwise it
    is silenced down ... :-(

* for the cppunittest needed:
  * a jabber daemon running on localhost.localdomain
  * two accounts configured in Empathy
    * libo1@localhost.localdomain
    * libo2@localhost.localdomain
  * libo1 and libo2 must be contacts/buddies of each other
  * both accounts need to be online in Empathy

* very nasty GMainLoop handling for cppunittest, MAYBE we could get rid of
  that in a real LibO, this might be responsible for some ugly behaviour
* contact channels seem to be successfully setup
* the client's callback TeleManager_DBusChannelHandler setup with
  TeleManager::connect() does not appear to get ever called
* hence the tube offer triggered by TeleManager_ChannelReadyHandler is never
  accepted
* unsure if the uniquify setup with tp_simple_handler_new_with_factory() would
  work at all, hence trying to have one instance un-uniquified, but to no
  avail
