/** is a one-instance service that provides access to a set of
    <type>Content</type>s via <type>ContentProvider</type>s.

    <p>Traditionally, this service implements
    <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XInitialization</type> and needed to be
    instantiated once with two arguments via
    <method scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiComponentFactory::createInstanceWithArgumentsAndContext</method>
    for configuration before it could be obtained via plain
    <method scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiComponentFactory::createInstanceWithContext</method>.

    <p>However, the only pair of initialization arguments used in practice is
    <code>"Local"</code>/<code>"Office"</code>, so this service is simplified
    now to automatically configure itself with that argument pair upon first
    instantiation.

    <p>(For backwards compatibility, the service implementation still supports
    <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XInitialization</type> and can still
    explicitly be initialized via
    <method scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiComponentFactory::createInstanceWithArgumentsAndContext</method>
    with two arguments of type string.  These strings are used as a pair of keys
    to retrieve a set of content provider descriptions from the configuration
    management (stored at
    <code>org.openoffice.ucb.Configuration.ContentProviders.<var>key<sub>1</sub></var>.SecondaryKeys.<var>key<sub>2</sub></var>.ProviderData</code>
    within the configuration management's hierarchy).  The retrieved
    descriptions are in turn used to register the corresponding content provider
    services at the broker.)
