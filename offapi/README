Contains all of the IDL files except those in [[udkapi]]

i.e. the interfaces that are specific to the OppenOffice.org application.
An artificial (?) separation.

The reference offapi/type_reference/offapi.rdb and
udkapi/type_reference/udkapi.rdb (formerly combined into a single
offapi/type_reference/types.rdb), used to detect inadvertent incompatible
changes, are maintained via offapi/type_reference/update-rdb.sh (see its usage
message for details) for cases where we deliberately /do/ become incompatible.
Old such cases are listed in offapi/type_reference/typelibrary_history.txt,
newer such cases are recorded in the git log of (now removed)
offapi/type_reference/types.rdb, new such cases are recorded in the git logs of
offapi/type_reference/offapi.rdb and udkapi/type_reference/udkapi.rdb.
