' ch_tools_grids.inc - Library for automation of the 'Insert::Grids...' dialog
' This Include contains a set of functions to modify the controls of the Grids dialog.
' All functions are designed to return error-codes depending on the behaviour of the action applied.
' Return codes:
' Error 0: Success.
' Error 1: The basic action beeing applied caused a serious problem, e.g. a crash.
' Error 2 TO 9: A functional problem occured.
' Error 11 TO 19: Wrong marginal conditions end up in Failure, e.g. control not visible.
' NOTE: This errors can also be used for 'negative' testing.
' Error 42: Wrong input. Probably only of interest during test development .
' Error 99: Unexpected behaviour - Shouldn't normally occur.
' ATTENTION:
' Only Errors 42 and 99 throw 'warnlogs'.
' All other errors are silent.
' They only throw QAErrorlogs the give a hint what probably went wrong.
' Expected Errors MUST exclusivly be handled by the calling routine.
