# This file configures the tExtensionHelp test case found in the files
# extension_help.bas and extension_help.inc.
# It contains information about the extensions and the entries they create
# within the help application
# If you want to add more test files, just increase the "count=" entry and add
# another section to the end of this file.

# Note that - beginning with CWS jl76 we can have a display name for extensions
# defined in the extension itself to be shown in the extension manager
# The item "name=" was introduced to cope with this. Usually "file=" and "name="
# are identical 

# The entries to search for in the help index are separated in three parts:
# 1) the help index string (hindex) to be found in the index
# 2) How many items to move down in the index to get the requested subpage
# 3) the header of the content page (header)
# both appended with an underscore and a unique, increasing number.
