Framework Tools Readme

In this directory you find a huge amount of functions used throughout the framework
module. 

These functions are separated into multiple files that can be included as needed.
You will find it difficult to find out which files you might need to include as
there exist internal dependencies.

This approach has been chosen to minimize the duplicated code within the module
but unfortunately this also causes a higher level of complexity - functions 
calling other functins which call another function from the third file ... - 
i guess you get the point.

Currently work is in progress to simplify usage by calling the required files
from within the functions that actually use them. This will cause a little 
overhead but is acceptable because the files usually end up in the cache anyway.

Additionally a file named "tools.html" is provided that lists all functions in 
this directory and - whenever possible - also delivers its documentation and the 
name of the file it belongs to.
Open the file in your browser and search for the function you need and you will
find out which .inc-file to include.

There might be redundant functions or functions that do not work at all and - even
worse - functions that do not work as expected. Please file an issue for them on
OpenOffice.org for the component "framework". 

Some of the functions are really old - usually you can identify them by massive
use of german variable names, others do not have any documentation. These functions
are subject to be replaced or reworked. Do not file issues for these, please.
