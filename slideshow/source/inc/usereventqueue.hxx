            This class registeres at the EventMultiplexer and fires
            events registered for certain user actions. Note that all
            events will not be fired immediately after the user action
            occured, but always added to the EventQueue (and fired the
            next time that queue is processed). Which is actually a
            feature.

            Conceptually, an event is an object that typically is
            fired only once. After that, the event is exhausted, and
            should be discarded. Therefore, all events registered on
            this object are fired and then all references to them are
            removed.

                registeres its event handlers.

                @param rEventQueue
                Reference to the main event queue. Since we hold this
                object by plain reference, it must live longer than we
                do. On the other hand, that queue must not fire events
                after this object is destroyed, since we might
                schedule events there which itself contain plain
                references to this object. Basically, EventQueue and
                UserEventQueue should have the same lifetime, and since
                this is not possible, both must be destructed in a
                phased mode: first clear both of any remaining events,
                then destruct them.
