            shapes.

            Shapes which implement the AttributableShape interface
            also provides this interface, providing methods to
            retrieve specific DocTreeNode objects from the shape. The
            methods mainly distinguish various ways on how to specify
            the actual DocTreeNode to return.

            If a requested DocTreeNode is not available when one of
            the methods below is called, an empty DocTreeNode will be
            returned (the predicate DocTreeNode::isEmpty() will return
            true). If, on the other hand, the shape cannot determine,
            for internal reasons, the internal tree node structure,
            all those methods will throw an
            ImportFailedException. This is, in fact, a delayed error
            that could also have been reported during shape
            construction, but might be postponed until the missing
            information is actually requested.
