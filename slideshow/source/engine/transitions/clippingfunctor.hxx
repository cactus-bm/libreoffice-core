            This class serves as the functor, which generates the
            final clipping polygon from a given ParametricPolyPolygon
            and a TransitionInfo.

            The ParametricPolyPolygon can be obtained from the
            ParametricPolyPolygonFactory, see there.

            The TransitionInfo further parameterizes the polygon
            generated by the ParametricPolyPolygon, with common
            modifications such as rotation, flipping, or change of
            direction. This allows the ParametricPolyPolygonFactory to
            provide only prototypical shapes, with the ClippingFunctor
            further customizing the output.
