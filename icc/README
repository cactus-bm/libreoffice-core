Library used to build the sRGB profile for PDF/A-1a export with patches.

This project is used to generate the ICC color
profile needed in module vcl in order to export
to PDF/A-1a.

It's composed of a small application, which lurks in:
[git:icc/source/create_sRGB_profile]

That application links to a support library
(icc/download/SampleICC-1.3.2), build at OOo
build time.

Finally, the application is run at OOo build time to
generate the only file delivered to solver:
sRGB-IEC61966-2.1.hxx.

If you need to change the data into the ICC profile,
please change the create_sRGB_profile.

The library was downloaded from [http://sampleicc.sourceforge.net] on 2007-08-23.

== Notes for porters ==

The endianess and other platform specific configuration
are in:

icc/<build>/misc/build/SampleICC-1.3.2/IccProfLib/IccProfLibConf.h

The patchs:
SampleICC-1.3.2.patch tweaks the build to use the endianness
detected in sal.
