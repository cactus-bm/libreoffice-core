OpenOffice.org - split build
============================

This package provides the possibility to build OpenOffice.org by pieces.  This
one is the base - bootstrap stuff that you need to be at least able to use
dmake and build.pl - essential OpenOffice.org build tools.

To build, do the usual

./autogen.sh or ./configure
make
make install

To get the rest of the needed pieces, do

./download
