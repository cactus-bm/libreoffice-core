legacy/identifier.oxt and explicit/identifier.oxt are two different extensions
that happen to have the same file name.  legacy/identifier.oxt does not have an
explicit extension identifier, so it gets the implicit one "org.openoffice.
legacy.identifier.oxt".  explicit/identifier.oxt has the
explicit extension identifier "org.openoffice/framework/desktop/test/deployment/
identifier/explicit/identifier.oxt".
