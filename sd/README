The core directory for the impress/draw applications.

Think of impress as a hack on top of draw.


sd module contains impress/draw specific code, non-shared UI and part
of ppt and pptx filter, few other filters too.

the slideshow UI lives here as well, the slideshow engine is in
slideshow module though (including the 3D transitions engine
slideshow/source/engine/OGLTrans).

the most used filters are ODF's odp, binary ppt and OOXML's
pptx. their locations are listed bellow:

 * odp import and export filters are in xmloff module (mostly xmloff/source/draw)

 * ppt import is in sd/source/filter/ppt (big shared chunks are also in svx)
 * ppt export is in sd/source/filter/eppt (big shared chunks are also in svx)

 * pptx import is in oox/source/ppt (and uses a lot of
   oox/source/drawingml and oox/source/*)
 * pptx export is in sd/source/filter/eppt (mostly in pptx-* source
   files) and shared part is in oox/source/export
