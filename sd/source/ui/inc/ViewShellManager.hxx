    and sub shells on the SFX shell stack.  They form a two level hierarchy
    (the underlying ViewShellBase, the only true SfxViewShell descendant,
    forms a third level.)  On the first level there are the view shells
    (what formely was called view shell, anyway; nowadays they are derived
    from SfxShell.)  On the second level there are sub shells (also derived
    from SfxShell) that usually are tool bars.

    <p>On the SFX shell stack the regular sub shells are placed above their
    view shells.  The FormShell is a special case.  With the SetFormShell()
    method it can be placed directly above or below one of the view
    shells.</p>

    <p>Shells managed by this class are created by factories.  On factory
    for the view shells.  For the sub shells there is one factory for every
    view shell.  Factories are set via the Set(View,Sub)ShellFactory()
    methods.  The FormShell is managed with the factory of its view
    shell.</p>
