/** The purpose of this container is to hold references to resources that
    are globally available to all interested objects and to destroy them
    when the sd module is destroyed.  Resources can be containers of bitmaps
    or the container of master pages used by the MasterPagesSelector objects
    in the task panel.

    It works like a singleton in that there is one instance per sd module.
    Resources can be added (by themselves or their owners) to the
    container.  The main task of the container is the destruction of all
    resources that have been added to it.

    As you may note, there is no method to get a resource from the
    container.  It is the task of the resource to provide other means of
    access to it.

    The reason for this design is not to have to change the SdModule
    destructor every time when there is a new resource.  This is done by
    reversing the dependency between module and resource: the resource knows
    about the module--this container class to be more precisely--and tells
    it to destroy the resource when the sd module is at the end of its
    lifetime.
