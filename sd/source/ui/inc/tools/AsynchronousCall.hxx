/** Store a function object and execute it asynchronous.

    This features of this class are:
    a) It provides a wrapper around a VCL Timer so that generic function
    objects can be used.
    b) When more than one function objects are posted to be executed later
    then the pending ones are erased and only the last will actually be
    executed.

    Use this class like this:
    aInstanceOfAsynchronousCall.Post(
        ::boost::bind(
            ::std::mem_fun(&DrawViewShell::SwitchPage),
            pDrawViewShell,

        this method is called while the current function object has not bee
        executed then the later is destroyed and only the given function

            The function object that may be called asynchronously in the
            near future.
        @param nTimeoutInMilliseconds
            The timeout in milliseconds until the function object is
