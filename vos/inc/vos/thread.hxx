/** OThread is an objectoriented interface for threads.
    This class should be the base class for all objects using threads. The
    main working function is the run() method and should be overriden in the
    derived class. To support soft termination of a thread, yield() should
    be called in regular intervalls and the return value should be checked.
    If yield returned False the run method should return.
