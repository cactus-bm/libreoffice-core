            If the BasicManager does not yet exist, it is created. In this case, if the application's
            BasicManager does not yet exist, it is also created. This is necessary since
            the application's BasicManager acts as parent for all document's BasicManagers.

            If you're interested in this case - the implicit creation of the application's BasicManager -,
            then you need to register as BasicManagerCreationListener.

                denotes the document model whose BasicManager is to be retrieved. Must not be <NULL/>.
                The document should support the XDocumentInfoSupplier interface, for retrieving
                its title, which is needed in some error conditions.
                Also it <em>must</em> support the XStorageBasedDocument interface, since we
                must be able to retrieve the document's storage. If this interface is <em>not</em>
                supported, creating a new BasicManager will certainly fail.

                you are not allowed to delete it. Instead, the given model is observed: As soon
