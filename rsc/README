Resource Compiler.

There is some German documentation about it in a subdirectory called [git:rsc/doku].
Seems to be very old (January 1992).

From rsc.sdw (in German):
The StarView Resource Compiler (rsc) is used, to convert the system-independent
resources in the description files to native description files which in turn are
compiled efficiently (runtime) by the system's native resource compiler in binary
resources.
