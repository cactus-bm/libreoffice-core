Contains non-graphical helper code for office applications.

In particular the SfxItemSet is a property-bag like container that
stores arbitrary sets of properties for everything from text run
formats, to Chart regression line properties.

There are lots of other useful helpers in here for various office
tasks; much of this code was originally moved from svx/sfx2.
