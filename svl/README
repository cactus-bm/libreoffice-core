Contains non-graphical helper code for office applications.

Specifically this module does not depend on or use includes from module
vcl. Originally all code in svtools that did not depend on vcl was split
off into this svl ("svtools light") module.

In particular the SfxItemSet is a property-bag like container that
stores arbitrary sets of properties for everything from text run
formats, to Chart regression line properties.

There are lots of other useful helpers in here for various office
tasks; much of this code was originally moved from svx/sfx2.
