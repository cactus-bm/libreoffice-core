<a name="3"></a>
<p><br>
<b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b>
<a name="3.1"></a></p>
<ul>
  <b>3.1. Application of License.</b> <br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>.
The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under
the
terms of this License or a future version of this License released
under
Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a copy of this License with
every
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,
You
may include an additional document offering the additional rights
described
in Section <b>3.5</b>. <a name="3.2"></a>
  <p><b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b> <br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
either
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
maintained
by a third party. <a name="3.3"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b> <br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
provided
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
Developer
in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
of the Covered Code. <a name="3.4"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>. <br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with
the
Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
know
whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification
is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists
or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered
Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
    <p><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>. <br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
interface
and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
necessary
to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information
in
the LEGAL file. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  </ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Representations.</b>
  <ul>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
  </ul>
  <a name="3.5"></a>
  <p><br>
  <b>3.5. Required Notices.</b> <br>
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the
Source Code.&nbsp; If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such
notice
in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be
likely
to look for such a notice.&nbsp; If You created one or more
Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit
A</b>.&nbsp; You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
rights relating to Covered Code.&nbsp; You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
indemnity
or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. <a name="3.6"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b> <br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements
of Section <b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if
You
include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
Code
is available under the terms of this License, including a description
of
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>.
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients'
rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
for
the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License.
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor.
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of any such terms You offer. <a name="3.7"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b> <br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
</ul>
<a name="4"></a>
<b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b>
<ul>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations
and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
LEGAL
file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all
distributions
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
</ul>
<a name="5"></a>
<b>5. Application of this License.</b>
<ul>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
attached
the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> and to related Covered Code.
</ul>
<a name="6"></a>
<b>6. Versions of the License.</b>
<a name="6.1"></a>

<ul>
  <b>8.1.&nbsp; </b>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail
to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All

expiration
of the 60 day notice period specified above. </p>
  <p><b>(b)</b>&nbsp; any software, hardware, or device, other than
such
Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under

against
Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
directly
or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such
as
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
the

in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer
software''
and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are
used
in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.

<b>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</b>
<ul>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable.
This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
States
of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
California,
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
party
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
</ul>
<a name="12"></a>
<b>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b>
<ul>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer
and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
basis.
Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
admission
of liability.
</ul>
<a name="13"></a>
<b>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</b>
<ul>
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
&#8220;Multiple-Licensed&#8221;.&nbsp;

The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software

<br>
KDE Crystal theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User
Interface, or
GUI.
<br>
Source code, for this library means:
<br>
- for vectors svg; <br>
- for pixels, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or <br>
otherwise png.
<br>
The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the
directory
containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
<br>
The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License
covers
the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.

Legal Terms
<br>
===========
<br>
<br>
0. Definitions
<br>
--------------
<br>
Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and
`FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by
the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the
`FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release. <br>
`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code
as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program
is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'. <br>
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType
Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless
otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as
distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a
particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to
verify this. <br>
The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert
Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified
below. <br>
<br>
1. No Warranty
<br>
--------------
<br>
THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL
ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT. <br>
<br>
2. Redistribution
<br>
-----------------
<br>
This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and
derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to
exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the
following conditions: <br>
o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
(`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the
original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be
preserved in all copies of source files. <br>
o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states
that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in
the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to
the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't
mandatory. <br>
<br>
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the
FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work,
you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. <br>
<br>
3. Advertising
<br>
--------------
<br>
Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the
name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes
without specific prior written permission. <br>
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the
following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or
advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType
library', or `FreeType Distribution'. <br>
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it.
However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this
license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the
right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using,
distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you
understand and accept all the terms of this license. <br>
<br>
4. Contacts

<br>
There are two mailing lists related to FreeType: <br>
o freetype@freetype.org <br>

and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are
looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything
to help you in the documentation. <br>
o devel@freetype.org <br>
Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific
licenses, porting, etc. <br>

Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo

ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but
instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation;
principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed
as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you
more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.
<br>
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely
distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
<br>
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is
covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding
cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this
reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG
software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the
unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will
support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the
remaining
code.
<br>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF
files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
produce
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
standard
GIF decoders.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE <br>
Version 2.1, February 1999 <br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to
copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
changing it is not allowed. <br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.] <br>
<br>
Preamble <br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
<br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
<br>
<br>
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation
and installation of the library.
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the
event an application does not supply such function or table, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute
square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
function must still compute square roots.)
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.
<br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:
<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if
the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the
application to use the modified definitions.)
<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy
of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather
than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will
operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user
installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible
with the version that the work was made with.
<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
distribution.
<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from
a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
materials from the same place.
<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
<br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
<br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
<br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

</ul>
<a name="3"></a>
<p><br>
<b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b>
<a name="3.1"></a></p>
<ul>
  <b>3.1. Application of License.</b> <br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>.
The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under
the
terms of this License or a future version of this License released
under
Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a copy of this License with
every
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,
You
may include an additional document offering the additional rights
described
in Section <b>3.5</b>. <a name="3.2"></a>
  <p><b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b> <br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
either
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
maintained
by a third party. <a name="3.3"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b> <br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
provided
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
Developer
in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
of the Covered Code. <a name="3.4"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>. <br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with
the
Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
know
whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification
is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists
or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered
Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
    <p><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>. <br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
interface
and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
necessary
to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information
in
the LEGAL file. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  </ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Representations.</b>
  <ul>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
  </ul>
  <a name="3.5"></a>
  <p><br>
  <b>3.5. Required Notices.</b> <br>
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the
Source Code.&nbsp; If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such
notice
in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be
likely
to look for such a notice.&nbsp; If You created one or more
Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit
A</b>.&nbsp; You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
rights relating to Covered Code.&nbsp; You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
indemnity
or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. <a name="3.6"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b> <br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements
of Section <b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if
You
include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
Code
is available under the terms of this License, including a description
of
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>.
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients'
rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
for
the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License.
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor.
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of any such terms You offer. <a name="3.7"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b> <br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
</ul>
<a name="4"></a>
<b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b>
<ul>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations
and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
LEGAL
file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all
distributions
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
</ul>
<a name="5"></a>
<b>5. Application of this License.</b>
<ul>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
attached
the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> and to related Covered Code.
</ul>
<a name="6"></a>
<b>6. Versions of the License.</b>
<a name="6.1"></a>
<ul>
  <b>6.1. New Versions</b>. <br>
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
be given a distinguishing version number. <a name="6.2"></a>
  <p><b>6.2. Effect of New Versions</b>. <br>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
of
any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
other
than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
Code
created under this License. <a name="6.3"></a></p>
  <p><b>6.3. Derivative Works</b>. <br>
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
Code
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
''NPL''
or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
differ
from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling
in
the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b> shall not of themselves be deemed
to be modifications of this License.)</p>
</ul>
<a name="7"></a>
<b>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b>
<ul>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,
WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
CODE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
LICENSE.
NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER.
</ul>
<a name="8"></a>
<b>8. TERMINATION.</b>
<a name="8.1"></a>
<ul>
  <b>8.1.&nbsp; </b>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail
to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
survive
any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. <a
 name="8.2"></a>
  <p><b>8.2.&nbsp; </b>If You initiate litigation by asserting a
patent infringement
claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
file such action is referred to as "Participant")&nbsp; alleging that: </p>
  <p><b>(a)&nbsp; </b>such Participant's Contributor Version directly
or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
such
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if

such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable.
This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
States
of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
California,
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
party
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
</ul>
<a name="12"></a>
<b>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b>
<ul>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer
and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
basis.
Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
admission
of liability.

<a name="3"></a>
<p><br>
<b>3. Distribution Obligations.</b>
<a name="3.1"></a></p>
<ul>
  <b>3.1. Application of License.</b> <br>
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>.
The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under
the
terms of this License or a future version of this License released
under
Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a copy of this License with
every
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,
You
may include an additional document offering the additional rights
described
in Section <b>3.5</b>. <a name="3.2"></a>
  <p><b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b> <br>
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
either
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
maintained
by a third party. <a name="3.3"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b> <br>
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
provided
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
Developer
in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
of the Covered Code. <a name="3.4"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>. <br>
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with
the
Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
know
whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification
is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter
and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists
or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered
Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
    <p><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>. <br>
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
interface
and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
necessary
to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information
in
the LEGAL file. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  </ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Representations.</b>
  <ul>
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
  </ul>
  <a name="3.5"></a>
  <p><br>
  <b>3.5. Required Notices.</b> <br>
You must duplicate the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the
Source Code.&nbsp; If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such
notice
in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be
likely
to look for such a notice.&nbsp; If You created one or more
Modification(s)
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <b>Exhibit
A</b>.&nbsp; You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
rights relating to Covered Code.&nbsp; You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
indemnity
or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. <a name="3.6"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b> <br>
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements
of Section <b>3.1-3.5</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if
You
include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
Code
is available under the terms of this License, including a description
of
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>.
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients'
rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
for
the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License.
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor.
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
as a result of any such terms You offer. <a name="3.7"></a></p>
  <p><b>3.7. Larger Works.</b> <br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
Work
as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
</ul>
<a name="4"></a>
<b>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</b>
<ul>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations
and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
LEGAL
file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be included with all
distributions
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.
</ul>
<a name="5"></a>
<b>5. Application of this License.</b>
<ul>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
attached
the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b> and to related Covered Code.
</ul>
<a name="6"></a>
<b>6. Versions of the License.</b>
<a name="6.1"></a>
<ul>
  <b>6.1. New Versions</b>. <br>
Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
be given a distinguishing version number. <a name="6.2"></a>
  <p><b>6.2. Effect of New Versions</b>. <br>
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
of
any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
other
than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
Code
created under this License. <a name="6.3"></a></p>
  <p><b>6.3. Derivative Works</b>. <br>
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
Code
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
''NPL''
or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise

WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
CODE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY

<b>8. TERMINATION.</b>
<a name="8.1"></a>
<ul>
  <b>8.1.&nbsp; </b>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail
to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
survive
any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. <a
 name="8.2"></a>
  <p><b>8.2.&nbsp; </b>If You initiate litigation by asserting a
patent infringement
claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
file such action is referred to as "Participant")&nbsp; alleging that: </p>
  <p><b>(a)&nbsp; </b>such Participant's Contributor Version directly
or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
such
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)&nbsp; agree in
writing
to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your
past
and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
withdraw
Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
such
Participant.&nbsp; If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty
and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties
or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
Participant
to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the
expiration
of the 60 day notice period specified above. </p>
  <p><b>(b)</b>&nbsp; any software, hardware, or device, other than
such
Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under
Sections
2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made,
used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
Participant. <a name="8.3"></a></p>
  <p><b>8.3.&nbsp; </b>If You assert a patent infringement claim
against
Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
directly
or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such
as
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
the
amount or value of any payment or license. <a name="8.4"></a></p>
  <p><b>8.4.</b>&nbsp; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1
or
8.2 above,&nbsp; all end user license agreements (excluding
distributors
and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
distributor
hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
</ul>
<a name="9"></a>
<b>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b>
<ul>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE
OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE
LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
</ul>
<a name="10"></a>
<b>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</b>
<ul>
The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer
software''
and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are
used
in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
Government
End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
</ul>
<a name="11"></a>
<b>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</b>
<ul>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable.
This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to
the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
States
of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
California,
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
party
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
</ul>
<a name="12"></a>
<b>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</b>
<ul>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer
and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
basis.
Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
admission
of liability.
</ul>
<a name="13"></a>
<b>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</b>
<ul>
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
&#8220;Multiple-Licensed&#8221;.&nbsp;
&#8220;Multiple-Licensed&#8221; means that the Initial Developer permits you to
utilize
portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the
alternative
licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
described

The VIGRA Artistic License
<br>
==========================
<br>
(modeled after the Perl Artistic License)
<br>
<br>
Preamble
<br>
--------
<br>
<br>
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which
VIGRA may be copied, such that the author maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the library,
while giving the users of the library the right to use and
distribute VIGRA in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the
right to make reasonable modifications.
<br>
Definitions
<br>
-----------
<br>
"Copyright Holder" of the VIGRA library is Ullrich Koethe, Cognitive
Systems Group, University of Hamburg, Germany.
<br>
"Library" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
Copyright Holder under the name "VIGRA" (including this LICENSE file
and all accompanying documentation), and derivatives of that collection
of files created through textual modification.
<br>
"Standard Version" refers to the Library if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
Copyright Holder as specified below.
<br>
"You" is you, if you're thinking about using, copying, modifying or
distributing this Library.
<br>
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item.
It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
same conditions they received it.
<br>
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis
of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
bear the fee.)
<br>
License terms
<br>
-------------
<br>
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the Standard Version
of this Library without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices, this license, and associated
disclaimers. <br>
2. The Standard Version of the Library may be distributed as part of a
collection of software, provided no more than a reasonable copying fee
is charged for the software collection. <br>
3. You may apply bug fixes and portability fixes derived from the
Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Library modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. <br>
4. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Library in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at
least ONE of the following: <br>
a. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, for example by allowing the Copyright Holder to
include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Library. <br>
b. use the modified Library only within your corporation or
organization. <br>
c. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. <br>
5. You may distribute programs which use this Library in object code or
executable form without restriction. <br>
6. Any object code generated as a result of using this Library does not
fall under the copyright of this Library, but belongs to whomever
generated it, and may be sold commercially. <br>
7. The name of the Copyright Holder or the Library may not be used to
endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific
prior written permission. <br>
8. THIS LIBRARY IS PROVIDED AS IS AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. <br>
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR ANY
DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER
OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THIS LIBRARY. <br>

PREAMBLE
<br>
========
<br>
The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
which the the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.
<br>
You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
and which you wish to distribute. This license may be particularly
suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated
to TeX.
<br>
The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
who are considering distributing their works under this license.
<br>
This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
that work may be distributed.
<br>
We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'
and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.
<br>
<br>
DEFINITIONS
<br>
===========
<br>
<br>
In this license document the following terms are used:
<br>
`Work' Any work being distributed under this License. <br>
`Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable law is derived from
the Work. <br>
`Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
applicable law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such
a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into
another language. <br>
`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
applicable law. <br>
`Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to
another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited
to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file
transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such
as Sun's Network File System (NFS). <br>
`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a
form where it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing
may include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
other activities. Note that modification of any installation facilities
provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work. <br>
`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the
Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright
Holder' under any applicable law. <br>
`Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for
running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work. <br>
A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not
considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external
component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively.
Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the
only applicable Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of
files belonging to the `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX
language'. <br>
<br>
CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br>
===========================================
<br>
<br>
1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In
particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.
<br>
2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
<br>
3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
directly from the Work.
<br>
4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may
also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works
distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
be updated versions of the Work.
<br>
5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
the Derived Work.
<br>
6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only
the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption
to a component of the Work. <br>
a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for
a component of the Work when that component is used with the Base
Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies
itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter,
the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and
unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component
to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter. <br>
b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent
reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived
Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes. <br>
c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of
the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the
reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work
unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such
support for the Derived Work. <br>
d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work: <br>
1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a
modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified
component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with
the modified component; <br>
2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy
of the Work. <br>
7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
regard to the Derived Work.
<br>
8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work
as
it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.
<br>
9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax
or
nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
applying that process. <br>
10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6
above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest
of the conditions in this license. <br>
b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to
allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in
Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work. <br>
11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
such works with the Work by any means.
<br>
12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.
<br>
NO WARRANTY
<br>
===========
<br>
<br>
There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in
writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
<br>
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the
Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of
the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not
limited
to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained
by
anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>
MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
<br>
=======================
<br>
<br>
The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
or simply that it is `author-maintained'.
<br>
The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
or act upon these error reports.
<br>
The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
significant signs of active maintenance.
<br>
You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.
<br>
If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
the Work through the following steps:
<br>
1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the
Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet
or similar search. <br>
2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still
maintained. <br>
a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update
their communication data within one month. <br>
b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within
the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance. (If
the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting
to comp.text.tex.) <br>
3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon
announcement. <br>
b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder
agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes
effect immediately upon announcement. <br>
4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the
Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people,
then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as
the (new) Current Maintainer. <br>
5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable
once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of
3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the
Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their
communication data within one month. <br>
A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.
<br>
If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also
announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
in 2b) above.
<br>
<br>
WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
<br>
======================================================
<br>
<br>
This section contains important instructions, examples, and
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in
this section.
<br>
Choosing This License or Another License
<br>
----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text
of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
your work is distributed under the LPPL.
<br>
The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains,
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any
license are encouraged to read it.
<br>
<br>
A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such
modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your
best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public
one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work
without altering any of its licensed components.
<br>
<br>
How to Use This License
<br>
-----------------------
<br>
<br>
To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a
statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
component is constrained by the conditions in this license.
<br>
Here is an example of such a notice and statement:
<br>
%% pig.dtx %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name % % This work may be
distributed and/or modified under the % conditions of the LaTeX Project
Public License, either version 1.3 % of this license or (at your
option) any later version. % The latest version of this license is in %
http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt % and version 1.3 or later is
part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 2005/12/01 or later. % %
This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'. % % The Current
Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name. % % This work consists of the
files pig.dtx and pig.ins % and the derived file pig.sty. <br>
Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions
given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring
to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.
<br>
If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'. However, we
recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance
section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to
the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
yourself.
<br>
<br>
Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
<br>
---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a

Important Recommendations
<br>
-------------------------
<br>
<br>
Defining What Constitutes the Work <br>
The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files
of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the
licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for
example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work
near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as: <br>
% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt. <br>
in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to
comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled
to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work. <br>
