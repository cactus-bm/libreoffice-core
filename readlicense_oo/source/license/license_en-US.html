This license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated to TeX. <br/>The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. <br/>This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed. <br/>We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. <br/><br/>DEFINITIONS <br/>=========== <br/><br/>In this license document the following terms are used: <br/>`Work' Any work being distributed under this License. <br/>`Derived Work' Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work. <br/>`Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example, the production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. <br/>`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law. <br/>`Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS). <br/>`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work. <br/>`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law. <br/>`Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work. <br/>A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'. <br/><br/>CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br/>=========================================== <br/><br/>1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work. <br/>2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause. <br/>3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work. <br/>4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work. <br/>5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work. <br/>6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work. <br/>a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter. <br/>b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes. <br/>c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work. <br/>d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work: <br/>1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the modified component; <br/>2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work. <br/>7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work. <br/>8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above. <br/>9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process. <br/>10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license. <br/>b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work. <br/>11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means. <br/>12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws. <br/>NO WARRANTY <br/>=========== <br/><br/>There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction. <br/>In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. <br/><br/>MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK <br/>======================= <br/><br/>The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is `author-maintained'. <br/>The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports. <br/>The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance. <br/>You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role. <br/>If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following steps: <br/>1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search. <br/>2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained. <br/>a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data within one month. <br/>b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.) <br/>3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement. <br/>b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement. <br/>4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer. <br/>5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month. <br/>A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license. <br/>If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above. <br/><br/>WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE <br/>====================================================== <br/><br/>This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section. <br/>Choosing This License or Another License <br/>---------------------------------------- <br/><br/>If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the LPPL. <br/>The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it. <br/><br/>A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution <br/>----------------------------------------------------- <br/><br/>It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components. <br/><br/>How to Use This License <br/>----------------------- <br/><br/>To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license. <br/>Here is an example of such a notice and statement: <br/>%% pig.dtx %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name % % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 % of this license or (at your option) any later version. % The latest version of this license is in % http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX % version 2005/12/01 or later. % % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'. % % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name. % % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins % and the derived file pig.sty. <br/>Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'. <br/>If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself. <br/><br/>Derived Works That Are Not Replacements <br/>--------------------------------------- <br/><br/>Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply. <br/><br/>Important Recommendations <br/>------------------------- <br/><br/>Defining What Constitutes the Work <br/>The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as: <br/>% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt. <br/>in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work. </p><p class="Horizontal_20_Line"/><p class="Text_20_body">The following software may be included in this product:MS Runtime Libraries; Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below:</p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Microsoft_Corporation"><span/></a>Microsoft Corporation </h2><h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__Runtime_Libraries"><span/></a>Runtime Libraries</h3><p class="P11">Microsoft .NET Framework Redistributable EULA <br/>SUPPLEMENTAL END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE <br/>IMPORTANT: <br/>READ CAREFULLYâ <br/>These Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft")<br/>operating system components, including any "online" or electronic<br/>documentation ("OS Components") are subject to the terms and <br/>conditions of the agreement under which you have licensed the <br/>applicable Microsoft operating system product ("OS Product") <br/>described below (each an "End User License Agreement" or "EULA") <br/>and the terms and conditions of this Supplemental EULA.

Definitions <br/>-------------- <br/>Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release. <br/>`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'. <br/>This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this. <br/>The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below. <br/><br/>1. No Warranty <br/>-------------- <br/>THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT. <br/><br/>2. Redistribution <br/>----------------- <br/>This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions: <br/>o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files. <br/>o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory. <br/><br/>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. <br/><br/>3. Advertising <br/>-------------- <br/>Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. <br/>We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'. <br/>As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license. <br/><br/>4.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">your programs, too.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">do these things.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">software, or if you modify it.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">these terms so they know their rights.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">modify the software.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">use or not licensed at all.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">along with the Program.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">these conditions:</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">you changed the files and the date of any change.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">License.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">announcement.)</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Program.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">provided that you also do one of the following:</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">distribute corresponding source code.

However, as a special exception, the source code distributed</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">accompanies the executable.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">4.

Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">or its derivative works.

Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work. <br/>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. <br/>5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use or distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are distributed to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a computer network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You agree that any External Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein. <br/>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. <br/>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer. <br/>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. <br/>9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein. <br/>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware. <br/>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License. <br/>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License. <br/>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. <br/>14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. <br/>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You. <br/>This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.

It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. <br/>"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) <br/>License terms <br/>------------- <br/>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the Standard Version of this Library without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices, this license, and associated disclaimers. <br/>2. The Standard Version of the Library may be distributed as part of a collection of software, provided no more than a reasonable copying fee is charged for the software collection. <br/>3. You may apply bug fixes and portability fixes derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Library modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. <br/>4. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Library in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: <br/>a. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, for example by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Library. <br/>b. use the modified Library only within your corporation or organization. <br/>c. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder. <br/>5. You may distribute programs which use this Library in object code or executable form without restriction. <br/>6. Any object code generated as a result of using this Library does not fall under the copyright of this Library, but belongs to whomever generated it, and may be sold commercially. <br/>7.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. </p><p class="Text_20_body">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. </p><p class="Text_20_body">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. </p><p class="Text_20_body">For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. </p><p class="Text_20_body">We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. </p><p class="Text_20_body">Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. </p><p class="Text_20_body">Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. </p><p class="Text_20_body">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. </p><h4 class="Heading_20_4"><a id="a__TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS_FOR_COPYING__DISTRIBUTION_AND_MODIFICATION"><span/></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h4><p class="Text_20_body"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">0.</span> This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". </p><p class="Text_20_body">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. </p><p class="Text_20_body"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">1.</span> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. </p><p class="Text_20_body">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. </p><p class="Text_20_body"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">2.</span> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </p><p class="List_20_Contents"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">a)</span> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. </p><p class="List_20_Contents"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">b)</span> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. </p><p class="P3"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">c)</span> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) </p><p class="Text_20_body">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </p><p class="Text_20_body">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. </p><p class="Text_20_body">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. </p><p class="Text_20_body"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">3.</span> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: </p><p class="List_20_Contents"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">a)</span> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, </p><p class="List_20_Contents"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">b)</span> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, </p><p class="P3"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">c)</span> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) </p><p class="Text_20_body">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </p><p class="Text_20_body">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. </p><p class="Text_20_body"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">4.</span> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. </p><p class="Text_20_body">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. </p><p class="Text_20_body">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. </p><p class="Text_20_body">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. </p><p class="Text_20_body"><span class="Strong_20_Emphasis">8.</span> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] <br/><br/>Preamble <br/><br/>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. <br/>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. <br/>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. <br/>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. <br/>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br/>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br/>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. <br/><br/>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. <br/>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. <br/>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. <br/>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. <br/>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. <br/>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br/>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. <br/>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. <br/><br/>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br/>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you". <br/>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. <br/>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) <br/>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. <br/>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. <br/>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br/>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. <br/><br/>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: <br/>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. <br/>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. <br/>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. <br/>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) <br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. <br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. <br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. <br/>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. <br/><br/>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br/>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. <br/>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. <br/>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. <br/>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. <br/>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. <br/>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br/>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) <br/>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br/><br/>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. <br/>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: <br/>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) <br/>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. <br/>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. <br/>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. <br/>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. <br/>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br/>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. <br/><br/>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: <br/>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. <br/>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. <br/>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <br/>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. <br/>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. <br/><br/>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. <br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. <br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. <br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. <br/>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br/>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. <br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. <br/><br/>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. <br/><br/>NO WARRANTY <br/>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br/>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS </p><p class="Horizontal_20_Line"/><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__LaTeX3_Project"><span/></a>LaTeX3 Project</h2><h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__The_LaTeX_Project_Public_License"><span/></a>The LaTeX Project Public License</h3><p class="Text_20_body">The LaTeX Project Public License </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">LPPL Version 1.3c Â 2006-05-20</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Copyright 1999 2002-2006 LaTeX3 Project</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â  Â  license document, but modification of it is not allowed.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">PREAMBLE</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">========</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">which the the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">Â </p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright</p><p class="Preformatted_20_Text">and which you wish to distribute.
