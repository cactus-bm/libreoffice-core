== Image swapping ==

LO has three kind of swapout mechanisms:

1) Manual swap out calls: Maybe it comes from old days, when memory was more expensive to use so LO tried to store
images in the memory only when it is really used and swap out them directly after use. These manual calls seems
useless nowadays and even ineffective.

2) Size based auto swapping: when the size of all graphic objects reaches a configurable limit (20 MB by default)
then some of the graphics are saved to the local file system and freed in the memory.

3) Time based auto swapping: more info needed.
