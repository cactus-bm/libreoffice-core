// This maps key states as occur as parameter, e.g. in IDropTarget::DragEnter,
// IDropSource::QueryContinueDrag, to actions as are declared in
// com::sun::star::datatransfer::dnd::DNDConstants ( ACTION_MOVE etc).
// If the grfKeyState indicates the ALt or right mousebutton then the returned
// values combines all possible actions. This is because those key and button are
// used when the user expect a menu to appear when he drops. The menu then
// contains entries, such as move, copy, link, cancel.
// An odd fact is that the argument grfKeyState in IDropTarget::Drop does not
// contain mouse buttons (winnt 4 SP6). That indicates that the right mouse button
// is not considered relevant in a drag operation. Contrarily the file explorer
// gives that button a special meaning: the user has to select the effect from
// a context menu on drop.
