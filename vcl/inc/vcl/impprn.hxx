/*
    ImplQPrinter is on most systems a simple buffer that allows a potential
    lengthy print job to be printed in the background. For this it saves all
    normal drawing operations for each printed page to a metafile, then spooling
    the metafiles timer based to a normal printer. The application can act in the meantime
    including changing the original document without influencing the print job.

    On some systems (currently Mac/Aqua Cocoa) ImplQPrinter has the additional
    purpose of adapting to the print system: here theprint systems starts a
    job and will not return from that function until it has ended; to do so
    it queries for each consecutive page to be printed. Also the Cocoa print system
    needs to know the number of pages BEFORE starting a print job. Since our Printer
    does not know that, we need to do the completing spooling to ImplQPrinter before
    we can actually print to the real print system. Let's call this the pull model
    instead of the push model (because the systems pulls the pages).
