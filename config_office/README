Various unresolved issues with configure:

* Providing the location of perl5 with --with-perl-home does not work.
Please make sure that perl5 is on your path.

* --with-gcc-home may cause a warning message to be displayed even if the
correct version of gcc is found. This should be harmless.

* It is at present time not possible to use --with-local-solenv to point
to a solvenv residing at a non-standard location.

Running configure on Windows NT:

* configure must be run from the Cygnus bash shell. On the bash command line
type "bash configure <options>" to run the script. The generated winenv.bat
file must then be executed from the 4NT shell in which you will be building
OpenOffice.

* The path to the Microsoft C/C++ compiler home directory must be given as
an MS-DOS format path on the command line with the configure option --with-cl-home 
or entered interactively when prompted. MS-DOS format names are <8 characters
in length and don't contain spaces. To get the MS-DOS format of a Windows
pathname select the directory in a window and right-click and choose properties.   

* configure automatically copies the top level makefile.rc from the config_office
directory to the top level directory when run. If you are not running configure and
are using a pre-generated winenv.bat to set up the build environment, then you must 
manually copy the makefile.rc file in config_office to the top level directory.
