Various unresolved issues with configure:
----------------------------------------

* Providing the location of perl5 with --with-perl-home does not work.
Please make sure that perl5 is on your path.

* --with-gcc-home may cause a warning message to be displayed even if the
correct version of gcc is found. This should be harmless.

* It is at present time not possible to use --with-local-solenv to point
to a solvenv residing at a non-standard location.

* The configure script also creates a bootstrap script in the top-level 
directory to support the creation of the build executable tools needed to 
bootstrap the build process. These tools normally reside in the 
solenv/$OUTPATH/bin directory for the supported platforms. It is hoped that 
these tools will be removed from the solenv tree at some stage. This 
bootstrap script does not yet work on Windows.

Running configure on Windows NT:
-------------------------------

* configure must be run from the Cygnus bash shell. On the bash command line
type "bash configure <options>" to run the script. The generated winenv.bat
file must then be executed from the 4NT shell in which you will be building
OpenOffice.org

* The path to the Microsoft C/C++ compiler home directory must be given as
an MS-DOS format path on the command line with the configure option --with-cl-home 
or entered interactively when prompted. MS-DOS format names are <8 characters
in length and don't contain spaces. To get the MS-DOS format of a Windows
pathname select the directory in a window and right-click and choose properties.   

* configure automatically copies the top level makefile.rc from the config_office
directory to the top level directory when run. If you are not running configure and
are using a pre-generated winenv.bat to set up the build environment, then you must 
manually copy the makefile.rc file in config_office to the top level directory.

* It is recommended that you close the Cygnus bash shell before you start the
build as it might cause problems later on.
