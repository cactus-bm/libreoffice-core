Various unresolved issues with configure:

* Providing the location of perl5 with --with-perl-home does not work.
Please make sure that perl5 is on your path.

* --with-gcc-home may cause a warning message to be displayed even if the
correct version of gcc is found. This should be harmless.

* It is at present time not possible to use --with-local-solenv to point
to a solvenv residing at a non-standard location.

Running configure on Windows NT:

* The path to the Microsoft C/C++ compiler home directory must be given as
an MS-DOS format path on the command line with --with-cl-home or entered 
interactively when prompted. MS-DOS format names are <8 characters in length
and don't contain spaces. To get the MS-DOS format of a Windows pathname select
the directory in a window and right-click and choose properties.
