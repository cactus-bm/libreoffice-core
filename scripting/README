From a clean CVS
you get 3 projects (the following order is the build order):
	- offapi
	- unoil
	- scripting
	
You need to set your environment:
/scde/webtop/re/bin/solarisenv.sh -s src663
you get two files called src663_sols.set and src663_sols.set.sh

*NOTE: The workspace number increments every fornight, as of 22/08/02, SRC663
is current, SRC664 in prepration

run a tcsh shell and source srx643_sols.set
setenv OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH to your {StarOffice/OpenOffice}/program directory 
setenv APPLICAT to your $OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH/applicat.rdb
you need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH `$OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH/javaldx`:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv CLASSPATH {full_path}/scripting/util/xerces.jar:{full_path}/unoil/unxsols3.pro/class/unoil.jar:
$OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH/classes/jut.jar:$OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH/classes/java_uno.jar:
$OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH/classes/ridl.jar:$OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH/classes/jurt.jar:$OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH/classes/juh.jar

then you can start to build.
cd offapi; build
cd unoil; build

Before building the scripting project, you need to merge the applicat.rdb
cd offapi/unxsols3.pro/ucr
regmerge $APPLICAT / offapi.db

cd scripting; build
this should build everything. If you want to build just some project just go to the directory and type
dmake.

you might have to do some extra dmake as the build is not correct.
cd java
dmake
cd source/scripturi
dmake
cd source/storage
dmake

Then after everything build you need to register all component into the applicat.rdb

cd scripting/unxsols3.pro/lib
ls
libprovider.so libscripturi.so libruntimemgr.so libstorage.so
libprovider.lib libscripturi.lib libruntimemgr.lib libstorage.lib

for each of the .so files run that command.
regcomp -register -br $APPLICAT -c file://{full_path}/scripting/unxsols3.pro/lib/libprovider.so
output:
register component "file://{full_path}/scripting/unxsols3.pro/lib/libruntimemgr.so"
in registry "/export/home/OpenOffice.org1.0/program/applicat.rdb" succesful!

Then registering Java components

cd scripting/unxsols3/class
ls
ScriptRuntimeForJava.jar StorageProxy.jar
regcomp -register -br $APPLICAT -c file://{full_path}/scripting/unxsols3.pro/class/ScriptRuntimeForJava.jar
-l com.sun.star.loader.java2
or
java -classpath $CLASSPATH com.sun.star.tools.uno.RegComp  $APPLICAT  register file://{full_path}/unxsols3.pro/class/ScriptRuntimeForJava.jar com.sun.star.loader.Java2

you can then run some test to check if everything is OK:
cd scripting/workben/test/provider
dmake
before running it you need to read the README File in that directory.
